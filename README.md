Product Service - Clothing Shop Microservice
The Product Service is a microservice responsible for handling all product-related operations in the clothing shop application. It is a part of the larger e-commerce system and interacts with other services such as Order Service, Payment Service, and Inventory Service. The service is built using Spring Boot and is configured to interact with MongoDB for product data storage.

Features
Product Management: Handle product CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
MongoDB Integration: Store product data using MongoDB.
Error Handling: Utilize global exception handling with descriptive error messages.
DTO Usage: Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API communication.
Security: Basic security setup with JWT authentication.
API Documentation: Swagger-based documentation for all exposed endpoints.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following software installed:

Java 11+
Maven or Gradle
MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-service.git
cd product-service
2. Configure MongoDB
Make sure you have MongoDB running locally or use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas. If you're running it locally, you can configure it in the application.properties file:

properties
Copy code
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/clothing-shop
For MongoDB Atlas, use the connection string provided by Atlas.

3. Run the Service
To run the service locally, execute the following Maven command:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The service will be running on http://localhost:8080 by default.

4. API Documentation
Once the service is running, you can view the API documentation via Swagger UI at:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
5. Endpoints
Here are some of the key API endpoints:

GET /api/products: Retrieve all products.
GET /api/products/{id}: Retrieve a single product by ID.
POST /api/products: Create a new product.
PUT /api/products/{id}: Update an existing product.
DELETE /api/products/{id}: Delete a product by ID.
6. Error Handling
The service uses a global exception handler to manage errors consistently. If an error occurs (e.g., a product is not found), the response will return an error code and a descriptive message.

Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "error": "Product with ID 123 not found."
}
7. Security
The service is configured with basic JWT authentication. You'll need to implement authentication endpoints and token management if needed for production use.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For building the microservice.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing product data.
